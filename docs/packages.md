## The Basics
Gigadex has huge package support from most of NPM. It also uses a custom-built package manager for Gigadex-specific packages like command upgrades or system utility programs. The package manager command is `dxpkg`. You can install NPM packages: `dxpkg [package-name]` and OS-specific packages: `dxpkg -`
